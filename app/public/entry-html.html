<html><body><p>Zebra Blue or Leptotes plinius is a small butterfly from the Lycaenidae family. It is easily identifiable by its unique markings on the underside. Here I am sharing the photos and the details I&rsquo;ve learned about it.</p>

<p>The above photo was taken from near the Madathala Rock Shelter at Chinnar in Kerala. It was morning time and the butterfly was sitting calmly on this leaf at around 3 feet from the ground. It was not at all bothered about our presence. Got a few clicks and trekked back after seeing the ancient rock paintings also. I have posted these pictures on the Chinnar WLS &ndash; Photo Album.</p>

<p>This photo is from the butterfly garden at Thattekad. Made it a little wide angled to include this violet flowers also. Butterflies seem to be very fond of this particular plant. In the local language it is known as &lsquo;narivali&rsquo;. May have other names too.</p>
<h3>Zebra Blue &ndash; Leptotes plinius &ndash; Details and Identification</h3>
<p>The shape is comparable to other Pierrot butterflies like Common Pierrot and <strong><a href="/wildlife/red-pierrot-butterfly-talicada-nyseus/">Red Pierrot</a></strong>. Size may be slightly smaller with wingspan around 22 mm. It is a common butterfly species.</p>
<p><strong>Markings:</strong> The under hind wing is primarily white and brown, and has some unique markings which make it easy to identify this butterfly. There are usually three markings or spots on the post-basal area, followed by some irregular shaped spots on the discal area. The post-discal area of the under hind wing has a 3 petal shaped spot, which is easily noticeable. The marginal area is separated from discal by a white part. The marginal area also has a set of brown spots followed by black spots near the tornus. Two of these black spots are big and bordered by blue and orange colors. Hind wings has tails.</p>
<p>As on the under hind wing, under fore wing also has a set of irregular spots starting from the costa.</p>
<p>The larval host plants are known to be from the Fabaceae and Mimosaceae families.</p></body></html>
